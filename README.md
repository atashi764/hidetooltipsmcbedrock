A simple resource pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that makes tooltips invisible.

Made by **randomMurgi** on **20230905**. 

## How it works?
Basically in /ui/hud_screen.json I added a codeblock from vanilla Minecraft which is responsible for showing tooltips. So I just changed the alpha (opacity) of tooltip text and backrground to 0.0. Thus, making the tooltip invisible. 

The file comes from Minecraft 1.20.12. I marked modified lines with // comments for easier understanding. (_Line 36 and 48 to be specific_)
